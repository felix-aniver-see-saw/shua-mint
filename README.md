# shua-mint
just files needed for my preferred customisation of my cinammon environment.

all descriptions of files and a general introduction are in the [wiki homepage](https://github.com/felixaniverseesaw/shua-mint/wiki)

all instructions will be based on the mint command line (ubuntu-based) and placed in [installation instructions.](https://github.com/felixaniverseesaw/shua-mint/wiki/installation-and-implementation-instructions)
