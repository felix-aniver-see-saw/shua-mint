# shua-mint
just files needed for my preferred customisation of my cinammon environment. (this repo is suited for cinammon 20 and above, and may or may not have the desired effect on previous versions.)

all descriptions of files and a general introduction are in the [wiki homepage](https://github.com/felixaniverseesaw/shua-mint/wiki).

all instructions will be based on the mint command line (ubuntu-based) and placed in [installation instructions](https://github.com/felixaniverseesaw/shua-mint/wiki#installation-and-setup-instructions).
